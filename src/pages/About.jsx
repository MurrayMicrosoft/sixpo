                SIXPO (Sexuality, Inclusion and Exploration) is a festival organized by and for folks with 
                disabilities, in which we will discuss, reflect and learn together about all sorts of topics 
                related to sexual wellness! There will be panel discussions, speakers and workshops, with plenty 
                of opportunities to engage in conversations with peers and experts about a broad range of topics.

                discussing sexuality, we will have events that are right for you!

              feel like you are a sexual expert, SIXpo is for you! Wherever you are in your relationship to 
              sexuality, that is where you are supposed to be. We can all benefit from learning together and 
              exploring a little more about sexuality â€“ so come join us!
